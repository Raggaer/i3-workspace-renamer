# i3-workspace-renamer

Simple i3 IPC script that renames Workspaces on-the-fly based on its contents.
All the renaming is handled by a `json` configuration file.

## How

The application subscribes to events and proceeds to rename the needed workspaces when each event arrives.
When the connection drops for whatever reason, the application will try to open a new connection every 5 seconds.
This is interesting for when you need to restart your i3wm instance and you run this application under your configuration file.

The renaming keeps the workspace number so is it still possible to switch workspaces based on the number.

## Configuration

All the configuration happens inside the `i3wr_config.json` file.
The configuration file is reloaded when the socket is closed (for example when reloading i3wm).
Below is a sample configuration file:

```json
{
	"separator": " | ",
	"class": {
		"gimp":          "âœŽ Gimp",
		"clockify":      "ðŸ—’  Clockify",
		"google-chrome": "â—Ž Chrome",
		"st":            "â–± Terminal",
		"discord":       "ðŸ—ª Discord",
		"spotify":       "ðŸŽµ Spotify"
	},
	"window": {
		"vim":  "â–¤ Vim",
		"gimp": "âœŽ Gimp"
	}
}
```

Specific matches for applications should usually go inside the `class` option.
Scripts that run on the terminal can be also matches with the `window` option (for example `htop`).
